jquery-hcal
===========

A jquery hcal parser to generate event calendars.

Loosely based on js-hcalendar (http://code.google.com/p/js-hcalendar/)

Takes hcal-formatted copy (http://microformats.org/wiki/hcalendar) and creates both large and small calendars. 

Rough examples are included. How you use it is up to you.
